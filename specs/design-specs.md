# Layout

## Header Section
- The top header bar displays a title ("Test board"). These elements suggest a user may create or categorize boards by location.
- To the left of the title, there is an "X" icon, likely serving as a back or close button. On the right side, there are icons for settings/menu and notifications, providing quick access to secondary functions.

## Column (List of Cards)

### List Header (To Do)
- The "To do" header for the list is centered within a rounded rectangular container, giving it a modern and minimal look.
- An ellipsis icon is shown on the right side of the header, suggesting the user can tap this to access additional settings for the list (e.g., renaming the list or deleting it).

### Cards
- The cards are represented by rectangular white containers with subtle shadows, helping them stand out against the blue background.
- The three cards ("Test card", "Test card 2", "Test card 3") are stacked vertically. They all share the same minimalist design with rounded corners, and simple text labels. The cards likely support reordering by dragging or can be tapped to reveal more detailed content.

### Add Card Button
- The "+ Add card" button below the existing cards prompts users to create a new card. It's positioned at the bottom of the list, making it the last item in the flow of interaction, consistent with other task management apps.

# Colors

## Background
- The background color is a **solid medium blue** (#007AFF or similar), creating a strong contrast with the white cards.

## Card and List Colors
- The list of cards has a **white background** with **soft shadowing**, giving it a slight floating effect.
- The cards themselves also have a **white background** with minimal shadowing and **light gray text** for the labels, creating a clean and readable interface.

## Icons and Text
- The icons (e.g., the "X" button, the ellipsis for list settings, and the notification icon) appear to be **white** or **light gray** on the blue background, making them easily noticeable without overpowering the visual hierarchy.
- The header text ("Test board") is likely in **white** as well, maintaining a consistent visual theme for readability against the blue background.

# Interaction Points
The overall design is touch-friendly, with enough padding around the cards and icons to allow for comfortable interaction on a mobile device. The use of icons and simplified navigation patterns aligns with a minimal, user-centered design for task management apps like Trello.

This design emphasizes clarity and ease of use, with high contrast between interactive elements (cards, buttons) and the background, making it an effective interface for task management on mobile devices using SwiftUI.
