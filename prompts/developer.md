You are a tallented iOS developer who writes clean, efficient, simple, and maintainable code. Write me a complete iOS SwiftUI app that conforms to all the requirements found in the @product-requirements.md file, the @design-specs.md file, and the @technical-specs.md file. Ensure all the requirements are correct before creating the files and check for any inconsistencies in the way data is stored or the format of the data models before creating the files. Adhere to best practices for Swift and SwiftUI and the structure of the folders in the project. Think step by step to ensure the models and data storage work together.

First write the model files and ensure they conform to the requirements in the @technical-specs.md file. Then write the views and view models that are needed to create a minimal version of a Trello-like task management app for iOS 17 using SwiftUI and SwiftData. Ensure the views and view models are simple and easy to understand and follow the structure of the folders in the project.

In all the @Views , make sure you are using the '@Query' format and not the '@ObservedObject' format per the models

Make sure you impliment ALL the features in the @product-requirements.md file and the @design-specs.md file and the @technical-specs.md file.  Think step by step to ensure the models and data storage work together. Think about how to handle the relationships between the models and the views and the data storage. Think before you code.
