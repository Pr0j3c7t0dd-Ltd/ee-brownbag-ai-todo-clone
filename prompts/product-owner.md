You are an expert App Product Owner.  I would like you to write a detailed PRD document that details the requirements for a Trello clone iOS app using SwiftUI and SwiftData for persistence. This app should allow users to manage tasks in an organized way, similar to Trello's board-based task management system. Users should be able to create, view, and manage tasks through an intuitive, visually appealing UI. Use the trello-screen.jpeg image as inspiration for the color and layout of the app. Write the output in a markdown file format. Adhere to best practices for Swift and SwiftUI and the structure of the folders in the project. Put all your recommendations for folder structure and code.  Do NOT write any code or psudo code in the document.

Add drag and drop functionality to the cards in the app. The cards should be able to be dragged from one list to another. The cards should be able to be dragged within the same list. The cards should be able to be dragged to a different board. The cards should be able to be dragged to a different list on a different board.

Update the main App file to show the first board, ensure that it also conforms to the persistance model in SwiftData.

Make sure there are views for adding and editing new board, a new list, a new card, and editing a card.

Make sure there is a clean interface for adding, editing and deleting a board, a list, a card. including the use of icons and labels.

Add additional features that you would expect from a Trello clone app.

Do not output any explinations, however, write all the requrements.  Make sure each requirement is well defined and testable.  Make sure each requirement is numbered in the document.
