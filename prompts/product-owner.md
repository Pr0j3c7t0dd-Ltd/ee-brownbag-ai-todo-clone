You are an expert App Product Owner.  I would like you to write a detailed PRD document that details the requirements for a Trello clone iOS 17 app using SwiftUI and SwiftData for persistence. This app should allow users to manage tasks in an organized way, similar to Trello's board-based task management system. Users should be able to create, view, and manage tasks through an intuitive, visually appealing UI. Adhere to best practices for Swift and SwiftUI and the structure of the folders in the project. Do NOT write any code or pseudo code in the document.

use the attached image as a reference for the UI and design of the app.

The app should allow the user to create, edit, and delete boards, lists, and cards.

Make sure there are views for adding and editing new board, a new list, a new card, and editing a card.

Add drag and drop functionality to the cards in the app. The cards should be able to be dragged from one list to another. The cards should be able to be dragged within the same list. The cards should be able to be dragged to a different board. The cards should be able to be dragged to a different list on a different board.

Make sure there is a clean interface for adding, editing and deleting a board, a list, a card. including the use of icons and labels.

Keep the product reqirements simple for the add, we can add additional features later.  For instance, sorting and filtering can be added later.  For now, we just need basic functionality.

Do not output any explanations, however, write all the requirements.  Make sure each requirement is well defined and testable.  Make sure each requirement is numbered in the document.
